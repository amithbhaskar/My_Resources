# C Sharp / Microsoft .Net 

## What is Microsoft .Net Framework?
The framework was meant to create applications, which would run on the Windows Platform. The first version of the .Net framework was released in the year 2002. Can be used to create
- Form-based applications
- Web-based applications
- Web services 

## .Net Framework Architecture
- Languages of .Net Framework
  - ASP.Net
  - ADO.Net
  - WinForms
- Library 
  - Framework Class Library
- Common Language Runtime (CLR)
  The Common Language Runtime, the virtual machine component of Microsoft's .NET framework, manages the execution of .NET programs and takes care of memory management via Garbage Collector program. 

## Components
- Common Language Infrastructure is a platform on which .Net programs are executed. It has the following inbuilt features:
  - Exceptioin Handling
  - Garbage Collection
  - Working with Various programming languages
    3 sections: 
	  - Languages: C# and VB.Net
	  - Compiler: Separate compilers for C# and VB.Net
	  - Common Language Interpreter(CLI)
- Class Library is a collection of methods and functions that can be used for the core purpose, Also called namespaces, is a logical separation of methods.
  Ex: A class library with methods to handle all file-level operations, reading the text from a file or to write text to a file.
  Most of the methods are split into either System.* or Microsoft.* namespaces. (The asterisk * means a reference to all of the methods under the namespace)
-Languages
 - WinForms : i.e for Forms-based applications, which would run on an end user machine. Notepad is an example of a client-based application.
 - ASP.Net : i.e for developing web-based applications (which runs on browsers) and Web applications would be processed on a server, which would have Internet Information Services Installed. Internet Information Services (IIS) is a Microsoft component which is used to execute an Asp.Net application.
 - ADO.Net : This technology is used to develop applications to interact with Databases such as Oracle / Microsoft SQL Server.

## Visual Studio for C#
Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft used to develop computer programs for Microsoft Windows. One can develop, debug and run applications using Visual Studio. Both Forms-based and web-based applications can be designed and developed using this IDE.
